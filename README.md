PHP is a widely used server-side scripting language that is primarily used for web development. It's often embedded in HTML code and executed on a web server to generate dynamic web pages. PHP stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor" and is known for its ease of use in web development, as it can interact with databases, handle forms, and perform various server-side tasks.
