PHP is a widely used server-side scripting language that is primarily used for web development. It's often embedded in HTML code and executed on a web server to generate dynamic web pages. PHP stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor" and is known for its ease of use in web development, as it can interact with databases, handle forms, and perform various server-side tasks.

Here are some key things to know about PHP:

Server-Side Scripting: PHP is primarily a server-side scripting language. This means that it runs on a web server and processes code before sending the resulting HTML to the client's browser. This is in contrast to client-side languages like JavaScript, which run in the browser.
Open Source: PHP is open-source, meaning it's free to use, and its source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This has contributed to its widespread popularity and a large community of developers.
Integration with HTML: PHP code is embedded within HTML, making it relatively easy to learn for web developers who are already familiar with HTML. You can mix PHP code with HTML to create dynamic web pages.

Database Connectivity: PHP is commonly used to connect to databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. It allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from databases, making it a valuable tool for building content management systems, e-commerce websites, and more.
